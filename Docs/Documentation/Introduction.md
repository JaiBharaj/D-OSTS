# Introduction
The objective is to develop a simulation that models the orbital decay of a satellite around Earth. This project involves two main components:
- **Simulator**: Generates truth data for the satellite’s trajectory and noisy radar observations.
- **Predictor**: Estimates the satellite’s trajectory and final position using the radar data.
